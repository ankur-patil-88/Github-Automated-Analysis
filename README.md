# Github-Automated-Analysis

In this project, a Python-based tool is build which, when given a GitHub user's name, returns the most technically complex and challenging repository from that user's profile.  
E.g. If user Name is ‘ankur-patil-88’ then it evaluates the most technically complex and challenging repository for the repositories in the corresponding user name.
